# Overview

Bastion is a library that eases the development of end-to-end tests for HTTP APIs. A typical user would write
tests using Bastion based off of some sort of API specification. This API specification can be anything like a
WADL file, RAML file or a JSON schema. A test engineer would prepare requests and responses based on these specifications
to test the overall process of calling these APIs.

Reference guide can be found on: http://bastion-dev.github.io/Bastion/reference/index.html

JavaDocs are available on: http://bastion-dev.github.io/Bastion/javadocs/index.html

# Usage

## Test

* `GET` Request:
```java
Bastion.request("Get the Restaurant's Name", GeneralRequest.get("http://localhost:9876/restaurant"))
        .withAssertions((statusCode, response, model) -> assertThat(model).isEqualTo("The Sushi Parlour"))
        .call();
```

* `POST` Request:
```java
Bastion.request("Change the Restaurant's Name", GeneralRequest.post("http://localhost:9876/restaurant", "The Fish Parlour"))
        .withAssertions((statusCode, response, model) -> assertThat(model).isEqualTo("The Fish Parlour"))
        .call();
```

* JSON Assertion: (property order in response does not affect test)
```java
Bastion.request("Get Nigiri Info", GeneralRequest.get("http://localhost:9876/nigiri"))
        .withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromString(200, "{ \"id\":5, \"name\":\"Salmon Nigiri\", \"price\":23.55 }"))
        .call();
```

* JSON Request:
```java
Bastion.request("First Request", JsonRequest.postFromString("http://localhost:9876/sushi", "{ " +
        "\"name\":\"sashimi\", " +
        "\"price\":\"5.60\", " +
        "\"type\":\"SASHIMI\" " +
        "}"
)).withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromString(201, "{ " +
                "\"id\":5, " +
                "\"name\":\"sashimi\", " +
                "\"price\":5.60, " +
                "\"type\":\"SASHIMI\" " +
                "}"
        ).ignoreValuesForProperties("/id")
).call();
```

* JSON Request/Assertion loaded from file:
```java
Bastion.request("Create Sushi", JsonRequest.postFromResource(BASE_URL, "classpath:/json/create_sushi_request.json"))
        .withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromResource(201, "classpath:/json/create_sushi_response.json").ignoreValuesForProperties("/id"))
        .call();
```

* Form URL Encoded Data Request:
```java
Bastion.request("Order Sashimi", FormUrlEncodedRequest.post("http://localhost:9876/sashimi")
        .addDataParameter("quantity", "5")
        .addDataParameter("table", "61")
).withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromString(200, "{ \"id\":5, \"name\":\"Sashimi\", \"price\":5.95 }"))
        .call();
```

* Bind the response entity to a model object:
```java
Sushi createdSushi = Bastion.request("Create Sushi", JsonRequest.postFromString("http://localhost:9876/sushi", "{ " +
        "\"name\":\"sashimi\", " +
        "\"price\":\"5.60\", " +
        "\"type\":\"SASHIMI\" " +
        "}"
)).bind(Sushi.class).withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromString(201, "{ " +
                "\"id\":5, " +
                "\"name\":\"sashimi\", " +
                "\"price\":5.60, " +
                "\"type\":\"SASHIMI\" " +
                "}"
        ).ignoreValuesForProperties("id")
).call().getModel();
```

* Groovy (using multi-line strings):
```java
Bastion.request("First Request", JsonRequest.postFromString("http://localhost:9876/sushi",
        '''{
        "name":"sashimi",
        "price":"5.60",
        "type":"SASHIMI"
    }'''
)).withAssertions(JsonResponseAssertions.fromString(201,
        '''{
           "id":5,
           "name":"sashimi",
           "price":5.60,
           "type":"SASHIMI"
        }'''
).ignoreValuesForProperties("/id")
).call()
```

## Dependency

Use a dependency management tool such as Maven to download the Bastion library for use in your project. Add the following
dependency to your POM file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>rocks.bastion</groupId>
    <artifactId>bastion</artifactId>
    <version>0.7-BETA</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, use Groovy Grapes to use Bastion in your Groovy tests/scripts:
```groovy
@Grapes(
    @Grab(group='rocks.bastion', module='bastion', version='0.7-BETA')
)
```

# Building

# Contribute

Bastion is an open-source project! Open-source means that we encourage you to contribute in any way you can. We will accept all contributions, in any shape
or form, that help make Bastion better. Here are some things you can do to contribute:

* Send a positive comment to the Bastion contributers. :)
* [Submit an issue](https://github.com/bastion-dev/Bastion/issues) on GitHub containing a bug report or suggestion. We ask you to spend a couple minutes before
  submitting an issue to check that it has not been submitted earlier. When opening an issue, try to include as much detail as possible so that the
  community can more easily address your concern.
* Submit a pull request for any of our [open issues](https://github.com/bastion-dev/Bastion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue). Some issues are more easy to implement
  than others and, if you're just starting out, these issues let you get used to the Bastion code structure. If you need any assistance, simply comment on
  the issue at hand and we'll be glad to help. We ask that you adhere to a consistent code style and employ good programming practice but don't worry if
  you're unsure about anything: we'll help you get your submission up to scratch as well.
* You can also [submit a pull request](https://github.com/bastion-dev/Bastion/pulls) which is not related to any of the issues currently on GitHub. If you have
  developed your own `Request` or `Assertions` implementations, for example, and you believe they could be useful to the rest of the Bastion community,
  we will add them to the library for use in future versions of Bastion.
* Help us make the front `README` better. If you feel like the `README` is missing information which you think should be there then open a pull request
  with your suggested changes. You can also help us with typos, grammar or anything else you see fit. Note that the front `README`
  file is auto-generated: to submit a change please [edit the `README` source file](https://github.com/bastion-dev/Bastion/edit/master/src/docs/md/README.md).
* Spread the word. Tell your colleagues about Bastion or write a blog post about Bastion. The more people we can tell Bastion about, the better!
